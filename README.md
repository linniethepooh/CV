# Lindelwe Ncube

An advocate of positive social change through the smart and responsible use of technology. Software development fascinates me as it's the intersection between science and art, it teams logical problem-solving with abstract reasoning and creativity. This is the reason I applied to [Le Wagon](www.lewagon.com), Europe's leading coding bootcamp, where I've learnt the importance of crafting code that is clear, clean and test-driven. I'm looking to build on these foundations in an ambitious team with a shared vision.

## Skills

#### Attention to Detail

Whilst working in finance, it was my responsibility to accurately calculate redress the bank owed to customers, a wrongly typed figure is the difference been a satisfied customer and causing detriment. During my tenure, I was able to consistently adhere to the 95% quality and productivity standard set by the client. This skill is also particularly useful when debugging, I am able to locate, identify and correct errors quickly in seemingly endless lines of code.

#### Fast Learner

In my previous job, I worked on a project where the process was constantly evolving depending on the needs of the client and regulatory changes from governing bodies. This meant I would regularly receive training about process changes that needed to be implemented, it was imperative that I applied my new learnings swiftly whilst maintaining the pace of delivery to the client. Through research and writing personal how-to guides, I was able to quickly solidify my understanding.

#### Teamwork

Our first team challenge at Le Wagon was to build a marketplace using Ruby on Rails. The set up of the project proved to be quite challenging. However, by ensuring my team stuck to daily stand-ups, check-ins and the use of project management software. I ensured the team remained cohesive, focused on our objectives and also made the week enjoyable. When reflecting on this week, I felt that the most important skill I had learned was how to work well in a team of developers, I took this learning with me into the rest of my time at Le Wagon.
